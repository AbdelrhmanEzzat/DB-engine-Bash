check_primary_key() {
    read -p "Enter the primary key value: " pk
    if [ -z "$pk" ]; then
        echo "Primary key cannot be empty."
        return
    fi

    # Check if the primary key exists in the table file
    if grep -q "^$pk:" ../Databases/$mydb/$tableName; then #-q stands for "quiet" it prevents any matched lines from being displayed on the terminal. 
        echo "Primary key already exists."
    else
        echo "Primary key is unique." ## True 

    fi
}
